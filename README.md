# Invade task

This project is built using React.js

## Explaination

I used reusable components to build it, a Product component is used to keep it simple, clean, reuse it whenever it's needed 
same with Input component

### Issues 

I still have an issue making the price filter work, also filters intervene yet don't stop eachother (I could pick two filters with one of them not having the other withing it yet it shows "it's simply which filter is picked second and this second filter overrides the first one picked")

### Flexibility 

 the website is very flexible to a point (463 * 607 px is the breaking point for the flexibility)

 ### Import

 I tried using Json server to watch the Json file but it needed an Object (the Json file is an Array of objects), tried fitching it from local folder it didn't work so I simply used the import method (don't know if this counts as a similar method to fetching "technically it's fetching since fetching an api is importing its contents from the backend")

 ### Tailwind

 I used Tailwind css to make it easier for myself, and also easier to read since styling with css for such small project could still be a pain both to write and read
